- Particles of the medium ***vibrate in the direction perpendicular*** to the direction of propagation of the wave.
- Made up of consecutives ***crests*** and ***troughs.***

## 2. Damping and Resonance
An oscillating system that is displaced and then left to oscillate wihtout the action of external forces, will oscillate at its **natural frequency.**

#### i. Damping
- An oscillating system that experiences a **gradual loss of energy.**
	1. External Damping 
		- Loss energy due to friction or air resistance.
	2. Internal Damping 
		- Loss energy due to stretching and compression of the vibrating particles in the system.
#### ii. Resonance
- When a **periodic force is applied** to an oscillating system **at its natural frequncy.**
	1. System oscillates at its natural frequency.
	2. System oscillates at maximum ampltudes.

## 3. Reflection of Waves
 | **Characteristics of Wave** |**wEffect After Reflection** |
 |---|---|
 | Angle of Incidence and Reflection | Equal |
 | Wavelength | Unchanged |
 | Frequency | Unchanged |
 | Wave Speed | Unchanged |
 | Direction of Propagation | Changed with the condition that the angle of incidence is the same as angle of reflection. |

#### i. Application of Reflection of Waves
Ultrasonic relfection is used to know the depth of the sea.

$$Depth,\:d=\frac{vt}{2}$$ 

Where,
$v =f\lambda$
$t = time\:taken\:between\:sending\:and\:receiving\:wave$

## 4. Refraction of Waves
Refraction waves is the change in direction of propagation of waves caused by **the change in the velocity of waves** when the waves propagate from one medium to another.

#### i. Refraction of Waves in Water
| **Characteristics** | *Deep $\rightarrow$ Shallow* | *Shallow $\rightarrow$ Deep* |
|---|---|---|
| Angle of Incidence and Refraction | Incidence > Refraction | Incidence > Refraction |
| Wavelength | Decreasing | Increasing |
| Frequency | Unchanged | Unchanged |
| Wave Speed | Decreasing | Increasing |
| Direction of Propagation | Refracted towards normal | Refracted away from the normal |

#### **Important!**

- Deep $\rightarrow$ Shallow - Towards
- Shallow $\rightarrow$ Deep - Away

Since the frequency of waves remain unchanged when it move from deep to shallow, then we can utilze this phenomenon to find the wavelength or speed of the waves.

$in\:deep: v_1=f\lambda_1$
$in\:deep: v_2=f\lambda_2$

#### ii. Formula for Refraction of Waves
```ad-note
title: #### Find the Wavelength or Speed of the Wave
collapse: open 
icon:calculator
color: 188, 32, 79

$$\frac{v_1}{\lambda_{1}}=\frac{v_2}{\lambda_{2}}$$ 

``` 

```ad-note
title: #### Wavelength
collapse: open
icon:info-circle

- Wavelength is the ***distance*** between ***crests to crests*** or ***throughs to throughs.***
- When total distance of wave is given, to find wavelength you must divide total distance of wave by the number of crest to crest.

## 5. Diffraction of Waves
Diffraction of waves is the **spreading of waves** when the waves propagate through a slit or side of a barrier.

#### What Changed in Waves?
Only amplitude and direction of propagation of waves will change upon diffraction.

- **Amplitude will decrease** due to waves energy diverges and spread out to a wider region.
- **Direction of propagation** will change **from one direction to many** directions because wavefronts spreads.

- Wavelength, frequency and speed of the waves will remain unchanged.

#### What Can Changed Waves?
Diffraction of waves is **influenced by the size of slit and wavelength.**
- Fixed Wavelength
	- The $\:\uparrow$ wider the slit size, the $\downarrow$ lower the spreading of waves.
- Fixed Slit Size
	- The $\downarrow$ shorter the wavelength, the $\uparrow$ higher the speading of the waves.

## 6. Interference of Waves
#### i. Principle of Superposition of Waves
- When two waves overlap, the resultant displacement is the sum of the individual displacements of the two waves.

#### ii. Interference with Coherent Source of Waves
- Interference of waves is the **superposition of two** or more waves** from a coherent** source of waves.
- Two sources of waves are coherent when the **frequency of both waves is the same** and the **phase different is constant.**
#### iii. Types of Interference
```ad-note
title: #### Constructive Interference
collapse: open
icon:info-circle

- Occurs when two crests/troughs are in superposition.

$$Combined\:Displacement=A+A=2A$$

```

```ad-note
title: #### Destructive Interference

- Occurs when crest and trough are in superposition.

$$Combined\:Displacement=A+ (-A)=0$$
```

#### iv. Pattern of Interference of Waves
```ad-note

$$\lambda=\frac{ax}{D}$$ 

Where,
$\lambda=wavelength$
$a=distance\:of\:between\:2\:sources$
$x=distance\:of\:between\:2\:adjacent\:nodal\:lines$
$D=\:distance\:from\:sources\:to\:screen$
