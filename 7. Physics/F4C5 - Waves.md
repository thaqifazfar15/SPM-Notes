## 1. Fundamentals of Waves

- Particles of the medium ***vibrate in the direction perpendicular*** to the direction of propagation of the wave.
- Made up of consecutives ***crests*** and ***troughs.***

- Particles of the medium ***vibrate in the direction parallel*** to the direction of propagation of the wave.
- Made up of consecutives ***compression*** and ***rarefactions.***

## 2. Damping and Resonance
An oscillating system that is displaced and then left to oscillate wihtout the action of external forces, will oscillate at its **natural frequency.**

#### i. Damping
- An oscillating system that experiences a **gradual loss of energy.**
	1. External Damping 
		- Loss energy due to friction or air resistance.
	2. Internal Damping 
		- Loss energy due to stretching and compression of the vibrating particles in the system.
#### ii. Resonance
- When a **periodic force is applied** to an oscillating system **at its natural frequncy.**
	1. System oscillates at its natural frequency.
	2. System oscillates at maximum ampltudes.

## 3. Reflection of Waves
 | **Characteristics of Wave** |**Effect After Reflection** |
 |---|---|
 | Angle of Incidence and Reflection | Equal |
 | Wavelength | Unchanged |
 | Frequency | Unchanged |
 | Wave Speed | Unchanged |
 | Direction of Propagation | Changed with the condition that the angle of incidence is the same as angle of reflection. |

#### i. Application of Reflection of Waves
Ultrasonic relfection is used to know the depth of the sea.

$$Depth,\:d=\frac{vt}{2}$$ 

Where,
$v =f\lambda$
$t = time\:taken\:between\:sending\:and\:receiving\:wave$

## 4. Refraction of Waves
Refraction waves is the change in direction of propagation of waves caused by **the change in the velocity of waves** when the waves propagate from one medium to another.

#### i. Refraction of Waves in Water
| **Characteristics** | Deep $\rightarrow$ Shallow | Shallow $\rightarrow$ Deep |
