- Particles of the medium ***vibrate in the direction perpendicular*** to the direction of propagation of the wave.
- Made up of consecutives ***crests*** and ***troughs.***

- Particles of the medium ***vibrate in the direction parallel*** to the direction of propagation of the wave.
- Made up of consecutives ***compression*** and ***rarefactions.***

## 2. Damping and Resonance

An oscillating system that is displaced and then left to oscillate wihtout the action of external forces, will oscillate at its **natural frequency.**

#### i. Damping
- An oscillating system that experiences a **gradual loss of energy.**
	1. External Damping 
		- Loss energy due to friction or air resistance.
	2. Internal Damping 
		- Loss energy due to stretching and compression of the vibrating particles in the system.
#### ii. Resonance
- When a **periodic force is applied** to an oscillating system **at its natural frequncy,** the oscillating system is said to be resonance.
