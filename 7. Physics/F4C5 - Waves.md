## 1. Fundamentals of Waves

- Particles of the medium ***vibrate in the direction perpendicular*** to the direction of propagation of the wave.
- Made up of consecutives ***crests*** and ***troughs.***

- Particles of the medium ***vibrate in the direction parallel*** to the direction of propagation of the wave.
- Made up of consecutives ***compression*** and ***rarefactions.***

$$Speed\:of\:Wave, v=f{\lambda}$$ 

Where,
$f =frequency\:of\:waves,\:Hz$ 
$\lambda= wavelength,\:m$

## 2. Damping and Resonance

An oscillating system that is displaced and then left to oscillate wihtout the action of external forces, will oscillate at its **natural frequency.**
