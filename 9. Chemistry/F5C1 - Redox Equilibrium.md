## 1. Oxidation and Reduction

| *Factor* | **Oxidizing Substance** | **Reducing Substance** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oxygen | $\uparrow$ increase  | $\downarrow$ decrease |
| Hydrogen | $\downarrow$ decrease | $\uparrow$ increase |
| Electron | $\downarrow$ decrease | $\uparrow$ increase |
| Oxidation Number | $\uparrow$ increase  | $\downarrow$ decrease |

- Oxidizing Substance is a Reducing Agent
- Reducing Substance is a Oxidizng Agent
- Reducing Agent is negative terminal, -
- Oxidizing Agent is positive terminal, +

| **Electrochemical Series** | **Acronym** |
|---|---|
| K | King |
| Ca | Can |
| Na | Not |
| Mg | Make |
| Al | A |
| Zn | Zebra |
| Fe | For |
| Sn | Sam, |
| Pb | Probably |
| [H] | He |
| Cu | Cut |
| Ag | Silver |

- Going up $\uparrow$ : less electropositive, easier to receive electron, strength of reducing agent increase.
- Going down $\downarrow$ :  more electropositive, easier to release electron, strength of oxidizing agent increase

## 2. Standard Electrode Potential, SEP

- More positive SEP:
	- Easier to donate electrons
	- Easier to undergo reduction reaction
	- Stronger oxidizing agents
- Less positive 
	- Easier to release electrons
	- Easier to undergo oxidation reaction
	- Stronger reducing agents
